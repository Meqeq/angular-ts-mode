* Angular tree-sitter mode

Simple mode for Angular with a Tree-sitter support for Emacs 29. 

This mode requires the [[https://github.com/dlvandenberg/tree-sitter-angular]] grammar to be installed.

It is based on the built-in =html-ts-mode= and [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/lets-write-a-treesitter-major-mode][this article]]. 

* Prerequisites

1. Ensure your Emacs was built with the =--with-tree-sitter= option.
2. Install the Angular grammar by running =M-x treesit-install-language-grammar= and providing the [[https://github.com/dlvandenberg/tree-sitter-angular][Tree-sitter Angular grammar]].

* Installation

Then you can install this package using =straight.el=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package angular-ts-mode
  :straight(:host github :repo "Meqeq/angular-ts-mode"))
#+end_src

Alternatively, copy the package to your =.emacs.d= and import it directly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'angular-ts-mode "~/.emacs.d/angular-ts-mode.el")
#+end_src
